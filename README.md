# VP-Portal: Federated Discovery and Query Platform for Rare Disease Research

Welcome to the vp-dp-frontend GitHub repository! This repository hosts the codebase for the Virtual Platform Frontend, a groundbreaking initiative aimed at providing a unified gateway for discovering, querying, and accessing a diverse range of resources relevant to rare disease (RD) research.

## About VP-Portal

The Virtual Platform (VP-Portal) is designed to revolutionize how researchers and clinicians engage with patient registries, biobanks, genomics & multi-omics repositories, knowledge bases, animal models, cell line libraries, omics deposition & analysis platforms, and translational & clinical research materials. This federated ecosystem is meticulously crafted to ensure that resources are made "Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable" (FAIR), while respecting the privacy of patient data and adhering to individual resource access conditions.
